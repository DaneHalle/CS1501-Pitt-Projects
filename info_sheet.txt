Name:  Dane Halle

Lecture section:  1280

Recitation day and time:  Thursday 11:00-11:50

Assignment #:  3

Program due date:  10/29/19

Handed in date:  10/29/19

Source code file name(s):
AptTracker.java
apartments.java
MinMaxPQ.java

Other file name(s) (if relevant):
documentation.txt

Does your program run without error?:
To my knowledge. Does have warnings.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
Warnings are from book provided code but code does still compile and run perfectly fine.

Additional comments to the grader: 
Added write to a file functionality with a provided filename. 
	- WILL OVERWRITE ANY FILE WITH THE SAME NAME PROVIDED IF IT SHOULD EXIST
	- If you want to test with the updated, simply replace apartments.txt with it or write to "apartments.txt"
Halle's Method of Madness (HMM)™️. Makes anyone that hears about the logic behind it go HMM.
